2. Algorithm: Item-item collaborative filtering

Item-item collaborative filtering, or item-based, or item-to-item, is a form of collaborative filtering for recommender systems based on the similarity between items calculated using people's ratings of those items.

Item-item collaborative filtering was invented and used by Amazon.com in 1998. It was first published in an academic conference in 2001. The authors of that paper, Badrul Sarwar, George Karypis, Joseph Konstan, and John Riedl, won the 2016 Test of Time Award for their paper Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. The International World Wide Web Conference committee stated that "this outstanding paper has had a considerable real-world impact".
